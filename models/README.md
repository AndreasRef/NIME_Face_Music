This folder needs to contain the landmark predictor data file for the examples using ofxFaceTracker2 to work, and it needs to contain the image-net-2012 weights and class names for examples with ofxCcv to work.

Run `sh setup.sh` from the root folder to download the `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` data file automatically from [sourceforge.net/projects/dclib/files/dlib/v18.10/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dclib/files/dlib/v18.10/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2), as well as [image-net-2012.sqlite3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liuliu/ccv/unstable/samples/image-net-2012.sqlite3) and [image-net-2012.words](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liuliu/ccv/unstable/samples/image-net-2012.words).

Alternatively, download those files manually and unzip the landmarks file.
